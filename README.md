# attendees example implementation

Requires PHP 5.5.x

Run `composer install` before starting to generate the autoloader and get packages.

You can run the specs in the spec directory with `bin/phpspec run` - there aren't a great deal
as there wasn't much in the way of business logic and testing the collection of data is generally
not very useful :)
